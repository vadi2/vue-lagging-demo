# packager-demo

> A FHIR packager app prototype to test vue.js Electron development

#### Reproduction steps

``` bash

    yarn
    yarn run dev
    Ctrl O
    Select https://transfer.sh/4QtUv/hl7.core.tgz to import, observe it imports OK the first time
    Select the same file to import again a few times - observe how the application's performance significantly degrades to an unacceptable level


```
